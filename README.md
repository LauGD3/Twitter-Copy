# Twitter Copy - A copy of the social network Twitter
This repository was created to improve my frontend development skills with TypeScript and React. I used a template from Vite with SWC to set up the project. The main goal is to replicate the visual aspects of the social network Twitter. While this is currently just a frontend clone, I plan to update it in the future by integrating persistence and a backend, making it a fully functional copy as close as possible to the original. This project serves as an educational tool for me to learn and apply modern web development techniques.
