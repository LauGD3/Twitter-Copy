# X Copy - A copy of the social network X
This repository was created to improve my frontend development skills with TypeScript and React. I used a template from Vite with SWC to set up the project. The main goal is to replicate the visual aspects of the social network X. While this is currently just a frontend clone, I plan to update it in the future by integrating persistence and a backend, making it a fully functional copy as close as possible to the original. This project serves as an educational tool for me to learn and apply modern web development techniques.

# Dependencies ðŸ‘¾

## Frontend
### MUI & MUI - Icons

MUI (Material UI) is the primary dependency of this project, and Iâ€™m using it to build all of the React components. Iâ€™ve been learning how to use this powerful tool as I code, referring to [the official documentacion:](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/). Additionally, MUI offers another package called MUI - Icons, which provides an extensive library of icons available as React components, making it extremely useful for quickly adding icons to the application.

If for some reason i need to install other dependency, i'll put here explaining what it does.
