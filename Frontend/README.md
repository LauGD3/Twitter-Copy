# Dependencies ðŸ‘¾

## MUI & MUI - Icons

MUI (Material UI) is the primary dependency of this project, and Iâ€™m using it to build all of the React components. Iâ€™ve been learning how to use this powerful tool as I code, referring to [the official documentacion:](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/). Additionally, MUI offers another package called MUI - Icons, which provides an extensive library of icons available as React components, making it extremely useful for quickly adding icons to the application.

If for some reason i need to install other dependency, i'll put here explaining what it does.

# How to setup & run the project

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LauGD3/Twitter-Copy.git
```
**3. Move to the Frontend folder:**
```bash
cd Frontend
```
**4. Install pnpm (Only if you dont have it):**
```bash
npm i pnpm@10.0.0
```
**5. Install dependencies:**
```bash
pnpm i
```
**6. Start the development server:**
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

# Run the project with Docker

Assuming you've already cloned the repository and installed dependencies, use these Docker commands:

**1. Build the image from the Dockerfile:**
```bash
docker build -t <tag> .
```
**`<tag>`** Here you can name the image whatever you want, this is great because you don't need to run a container with the ID.
*This will create an image that you can view by running docker images" in your terminal or using docker desktop*

**2. Run the image to create a container:**
```bash
docker run -p 8000:5173 <tag:v1>
```
**`<8000>`** Here you put the port that you want to use to run the proyect. **`<5173>`** Here, is the port that uses the container in this case, 5173, if you, for some reason need change this, go to [vite.config.ts](./vite.config.ts), and change the port in the object called "server". **`<tag:v1>`** This is the name of the container, you can call it whatever you want

**3. Run in developer mode (hot-reloading):** 
```bash
  docker run -p 8000:5173 -v $(pwd):/app <tag>
```

This third command will run the project, the difference is that any changes you make to the code will be shown to you.

# About the Twitter-chirp Font

This font family was created by Twitter and is proprietary, intended exclusively for use by the company's team. However, I came across an unofficial copy on GitHub. [Here is the repository:](https://github.com/edwardbetes/chirp-font).
